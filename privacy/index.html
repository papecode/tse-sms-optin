        <p>However, your phone number IS processed by Twilio, Inc., our SMS service provider, which is necessary to deliver messages to your mobile phone. Twilio's use of your data is governed by Twilio's Privacy Policy (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/privacy). We have a Data Processing Agreement in place with Twilio to ensure your data is handled in compliance with applicable laws.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Explicit Opt-In and Consent</h2>
        <p>You have explicitly consented to receive SMS messages from The Socratic Experience by:</p>

            <li>Visiting https://sms-registration.socraticexperience.com/</li>
            <li>Entering your phone number</li>

        <p>Your consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. We do NOT use pre-checked boxes, implied consent, or negative opt-in methods.</p>
        
        <h2>6. SMS Message Standards and Frequency</h2>
        <p>SMS messages sent through this campaign will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Originate from a Twilio-provisioned, A2P 10DLC-compliant phone number</li>
            <li>Contain clear identification of the sender (The Socratic Experience or "TSE")</li>
            <li>Relate exclusively to the TSE Academy Open House event</li>
            <li>Include the message "Reply STOP to opt out" or similar language</li>
            <li>Be sent only during reasonable hours (7:00 AM to 9:00 PM in the recipient's timezone, where possible)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Message frequency is expected to be minimal (typically 1-3 messages per day during the event period, and no messages after the event concludes). The exact number of messages depends on event scheduling and changes.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Your Rights and Opt-Out Options</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt Out:</strong> Stop receiving SMS messages at any time by replying "STOP" to any SMS message. You will receive a confirmation message: "You have successfully been unsubscribed. You will not receive any more messages from this number. Reply START to resubscribe."</li>
            <li><strong>Get Help:</strong> Reply "HELP" to any SMS message to receive information about the service</li>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your phone number against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is transmitted over secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)</li>

            <li>We maintain firewalls and access controls limiting data access to authorized personnel only</li>
            <li>We do not store phone numbers in plain text or unsecured formats</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>However, no method of internet or wireless transmission is 100% secure. While we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
